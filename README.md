Movies Subscriptions Managment website

The system provides a secure login page for authorized users, with an Admin user responsible for managing other users. User data is stored in JSON files and the MongoDB UsersDB, which includes features such as session timeout and user permissions.
The front-end of the web site is built using React and Redux (RTK â€“Query), offering a seamless user experience. The main page presents a menu for managing movies, subscriptions, and user accounts, while only the Admin can access the "Manage Users" section.
The Movies and Subscriptions management pages allow users to add, edit, delete and search movies and subscriptions, with permissions controlling access to certain actions. The system ensures that users can only access appropriate features based on their permissions.
